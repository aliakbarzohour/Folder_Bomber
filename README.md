Hello friends, welcome to this project. I made this project just for fun, and of course, if the opportunity arises, I will definitely try it on my friends ðŸ¤£.
I saw this project for the first time on YouTube and the idea came to me to make a good one myself.
This virus is not going to do anything illegal or annoying, and as I said (this project is made for fun only).
This Python program builds a folder as many as requested when running on a system (if it is built in large numbers, the system hangs).
